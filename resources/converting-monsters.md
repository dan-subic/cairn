# Converting Monsters

The below was written by Yochai Gal for Cairn.

There is no perfect system for converting from other systems.  
Below are some tips that might help with the process!

## The Basics
Review the instructions in the [SRD](/obelisk/obelisk-srd/#creating-monsters). A couple of things to keep in mind:
- OSE (or B / X) has really great stat blocks to start with. Just ignore THAC0.
- Dungeon World has some great monster "moves" that translate to Critical Damage quite nicely, so looking for an equivalent creature in that system can really help! See this example [here](http://codex.dungeon-world.com/monster/5698559156420608).
- A good rule of thumb is that OSR 1 HD = 1 HP, keeping in mind that the minimum is 3 or 4 HP (Cairn). I usually think of HD as equivalent to a d6, which has a mean of 3.5.
- **Hit Protection** is _not_ health. It's the creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill.
- **Strength** is both health and physical power. Sometimes HP/HD from other systems is better represented in **STR** than in **Hit Protection**.
- **Willpower** is tricky. It rarely comes up but when it does, it's nice to have. High **WIL** is strong personality, spirit or presence.
- Attack **damage** is pretty straightforward coming from games like OSE (or B / X); you can usually just copy them as-is. Double-check with the [weapons table](/obelisk/obelisk-srd/#weapons) if unsure.
- Multiple attacks (e.g. 2 x claw, 1 x sting) typically convert to [_Blast_](/obelisk/obelisk-srd#Blast) and/or the "two weapons" rule (e.g. d6+d6 is roll 2d6, keep highest).
- When in doubt, think about how much serious damage the creature is supposed to do. Remember that instead of raising attack damage a step, think about giving it a _bonus_ in certain situations or use the _Blast_ and "two weapons" rule.
- Spells are tricky; you can give wizardy-types Spellbooks but remember, the creature might _drop_ them when they are defeated. I like to make 1d4 dropped Spellbooks implode ([Die of Fate](/obelisk/obelisk-srd#die-of-fate)).
- Magical creatures can just "know" a bunch of spells. In this case make their corpse magical (and dangerous).
- Sometimes a direct stat to stat translation isn't an option. That's OK! There is a way (see below).

## Use The Fiction
Read the original stat block and surrounding commentary, then write a few sentences about the creature. Then convert what you've written to the Cairn monster stat block.

Take for example this OSR creature:

#### Foxwoman
Can take the form of a fox, a woman, or a 7' tall fox-headed.  
HD d8 HP HDx4 Speed 120' Armor 14 Morale 11 Attack: +4 d8hp (claw, bite or choke)
- Defense: Cannot be harmed by metal
- Special: Can transform into a fox or a maiden with one fox leg hidden (same stats) at will

_**Using the example above, I can see that she:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Looking at the stats, it seems like she doesn't have too high HP, and she's quite fast.
- Agile and lithe.
- Attacks with deadly teeth and claws (choking her prey if possible).
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to metal weapons.

_**What can we learn from this?**_  
- She's fast, and probably savvy in a fight. She probably has higher than average Hit Protection (regular humans have 3 HP). **6 HP**.
- I don't think foxes have protective hides, and she's otherwise human beside her head. **No Armor**.
- She is decently strong. Normal human is 10 and she's bigger. **12 STR**.
- I can imagine her hunting prey over the snowy tundra. She's fast. **14 DEX**.
- Foxes are pretty cunning, right? Probably forceful and proactive in a tough situation. **11 WIL**.
- I'd go with **bite (d6)** for the teeth attack, and **claws (d8+d8)**, the same as any two-handed weapon.

_**In summary, that leaves us with the following opening statblock:**_  
6 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)

_**Now on to her abilities:**_  
This is pretty straightforward. We simply read the fictional stat block we created earlier!
- We know what she looks like, and that she can transform into a fox at will.
- She cannot be harmed by metal; I'm taking this to mean she's immune to _metal weapons_.
- She chokes her victims.

_**Easy, right? Now to make it useful:**_  
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on.

_**And that's it!**_
_**Behold, a converted Cairn monster:**_

#### Foxwoman
6 HP, 12 STR, 14 DEX, 11 WIL, teeth (d6), claws (d8+d8)
- Appears as a 7-foot tall with a human woman with the head of a fox.
- Transforms into a fox at will.
- Immune to attacks from metal weapons.
- Critical damage: victim is choked unconscious, to be fed on.
